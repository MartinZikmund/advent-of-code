# Advent of Code (C#)

My solutions to Advent of Code puzzles.

Each solution is in its own class, found in [`src/AdventOfCode.Puzzles/`](https://github.com/MartinZikmund/advent-of-code/tree/main/src/AdventOfCode.Puzzles). The accompanying Uno Platform app makes it easier to execute each puzzle against test data/custom input file.
